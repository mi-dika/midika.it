# Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosure.

## Report a vulnerability

Please use GitHub’s private security advisories:

- Report here: https://github.com/mi-dika/midika.it/security/advisories/new

This creates a private thread with the maintainers. Do not open a public issue for security reports.

## PGP / email

We do not currently accept reports via email to minimize spam. If a private channel is required, we will coordinate one within the advisory thread.

## Supported versions

This is a website repository. We generally fix security issues on the `main` branch and deploy promptly.
